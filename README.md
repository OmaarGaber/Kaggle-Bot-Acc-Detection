Kaggle Bot Account Detection

One of the most important and best projects in which I had a very good experience
The project talks about Bot Accounts that are on Kaggle because, as we know, kaggle is one of the largest sites that have data in the world and the largest in terms of the compitions that work on it, but engineers who are interested in the field of data are in science
Any of the competitions on this site will be judged by voting, and therefore the only way to cheat is to win by bot accounts by voting, and from here the idea of this data set came from

At the beginning, I would just like to say that the difficulty of this project was defining the features that I will work on, and that I choose the measures that I will form my columns with, or that I will digest them together, and this was one of the problems of my understanding of the data set.

1- The Exploring Data stage, and the data was very large, and this was one of the problems, and I was facing the problem of understanding the data and delving into it so that I could determine which feature I could work on. By the grace of God, I understood the data greatly

2- The Data Cleaning stage is a stage that is considered the basis of any project, and it had a problem that the null was a little big because it was data about the boots, and its number reached 125,000 out of more than 1,300,000 (from one million and 300 thousand rows), so there were some problems in the operations related to statistics

3- The Data Processing stage, and this stage is the basis for visualisations, so I tried as much as I could to organize and understand what columns I could use to form Measure that I could rely on. In addition, I made a groupby for some things because I had a feature linked to places around the world and so on..

4- The stage of data visualization was a stage that was not the best thing for me, especially that I agreed between the axes and chose the appropriate graph for what I show, and chose the most appropriate feature and the most appropriate groupby that I can benefit from more - you may find the visualisations a bit small due to the large data such as columns, but I tried as much as I could I can see the correct relationships in the exact graphs

5- Finally, I made a DashBoard using Power BI - suitable and put in it the most important measures and features that answer the fastest statistic once you click - all of the data are dynamic and this makes it very easy to make any decision - in addition to the map feature that gives you the possibility to specify any number of areas once using the map only The Dashboard is formed according to the areas you specify - and Slicer made it possible for you to know the IPV4 of this person, you can locate him and classify him on any Graph
